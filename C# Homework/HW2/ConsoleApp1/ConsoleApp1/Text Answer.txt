What are the six combinations of access modifier keywords and what do they do?

public: Accessible by any code.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the same class and by derived classes.
internal: Accessible only within the same assembly.
protected internal: Accessible within the same assembly or by derived classes.
private protected: Accessible within the same class or derived classes within the same assembly.

What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to a type member?

static: Belongs to the type itself rather than an instance.
const: Represents a constant value, must be initialized at declaration and cannot be changed.
readonly: Represents a field that can be assigned at declaration or in the constructor but not changed thereafter.

What does a constructor do?

A constructor initializes an object of a class.

Why is the partial keyword useful?

The partial keyword allows a class, struct, or interface to be split across multiple files. 

What is a tuple?

A tuple is a data structure that can hold multiple elements of different types. 

What does the C# record keyword do?

The record keyword defines a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data.

What does overloading and overriding mean?

Overloading: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same scope.
Overriding: Providing a new implementation of a method in a derived class that has the same signature as a method in the base class.

What is the difference between a field and a property?

Field: A variable that holds data directly.
Property: Provides a way to read, write, or compute the value of a private field, typically with get and set accessors.

How do you make a method parameter optional?

By providing a default value for the parameter, e.g., void Method(int x = 0).

What is an interface and how is it different from an abstract class?

Interface: Defines a contract with no implementation. All members are implicitly public and abstract.
Abstract class: Can contain implementation, fields, and different access modifiers. It serves as a base class for other classes.

What accessibility level are members of an interface?

Members of an interface are implicitly public.

True/False. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations of the same method.

True.

True/False. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.

True.

True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.

False.

True/False. Abstract methods can be used in a normal (non-abstract) class.

False.

True/False. Normal (non-abstract) methods can be used in an abstract class.

True.

True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class.

True.

True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class.

True.

True/False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was neither virtual nor abstract in the base class.

False.

True/False. A class that implements an interface does not have to provide an implementation for all of the members of the interface.

False.

True/False. A class that implements an interface is allowed to have other members that arenâ€™t defined in the interface.

True.

True/False. A class can have more than one base class.

False.

True/False. A class can implement more than one interface.

True.
